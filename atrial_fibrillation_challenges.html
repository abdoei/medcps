<h1>Atrial arrhythmia</h1>
<p>A healthy heart has a regular sequence of activations, while a diseased heart has irregular activations, which leads to insufficient plumbing of blood. In the United States, it is estimated that 12 million people will have atrial fibrillation in 2030. It contributes to about 160 thousand deaths each year. Symptoms include fast heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, etc.</p>

<p>The main treatments are: Use medicines to control the heartâ€™s rhythm and rate; Surgery; Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage atrial fibrillation risk factors. Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive surgery, which catheters are inserted into the left atrium for mapping and ablation. The tip of the ablation catheter can generate heat to kill diseased cells, to restore normal activation.</p>
