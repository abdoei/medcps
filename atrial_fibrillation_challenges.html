<h1>Atrial arrhythmia</h1>
<p>A healthy heart has a regular sequence of activations, while a diseased heart has irregular activations, which leads to insufficient plumbing of blood. In the United States, it is estimated that 12 million people will have atrial fibrillation in 2030. It contributes to about 160 thousand deaths each year. Symptoms include fast heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, etc.</p>

<p>The main treatments are: Use medicines to control the heartâ€™s rhythm and rate; Surgery; Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage atrial fibrillation risk factors. Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive surgery, which catheters are inserted into the left atrium for mapping and ablation. The tip of the ablation catheter can generate heat to kill diseased cells, to restore normal activation.</p>

<p>Here are some photos of the catheter ablation operating room. Thers is the patient table behind the glass where the physician operate the procedure. Technician work with the physician via the mapping system. The mapping system displays spatial and temporal data to help the physician find arrhythmia source locations.</p>

<p>Catheters are passed through a vein to reach the heart. They may be inserted in the groin, shoulder or neck. The 3D mapping system takes in electrograms from the catheters and creates colored maps to help the physician pinpoint the abnormal tissue. As illustrates in the figure below, there are ablations create a line of block to the abnormal activations from the pulmonary veins, and there is a cluster of ablations stop abnormal activations from a focal source.</p>
